This jupyter script is developed for reading the average output file from long term tracking. 

Note the data in this folder comes from the avg output "avg.dat" from the long_term tracking. 
The naming of the data file follows:
  e.g. r_her-1-17000
  
  r_ in the txt file name denotes both the radiation damping and fluctuation are turned on when doing the long term tracking.
  rd_ in the txt file name denotes only the radiation damping is on.
  If there is no r_ or rd_, the radiation effects are not involved in the tracking. 
  
  "1" denotes number of particles to track 
  "17000" denotes number of turns to track
